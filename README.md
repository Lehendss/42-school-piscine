The 'PISCINE' was a challenging experience in many aspects, from the technical ones with many hours of writing code and analyzing problems, to the interpersonal growth required for effective communication, time management, and maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

Each project we undertook provided a fresh opportunity to apply the knowledge we had acquired. The collaborative effort of everyone I encountered during this period played a pivotal role in making this journey possible. It offered me a new perspective on teamwork, unveiling aspects of myself that I hadn't realized existed.
